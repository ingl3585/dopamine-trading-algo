### Clean Code Principles

**Apply rigorous software engineering standards:**

1. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
   - Open/Closed: Extensible without modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Proper inheritance hierarchies
   - Interface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

2. **Design Patterns**
   - **Factory Pattern** for creating neural architectures
   - **Strategy Pattern** for swappable algorithms
   - **Observer Pattern** for event-driven updates
   - **Command Pattern** for trade execution
   - **Builder Pattern** for complex model construction

3. **Code Quality Standards**
   - **Type hints** throughout (Python 3.9+ syntax)
   - **Docstrings** with Google/NumPy style
   - **Unit tests** with >90% coverage
   - **Integration tests** for critical paths
   - **Performance tests** for latency-sensitive components
   - **Linting** with ruff/black/mypy
   - **Pre-commit hooks** for automated quality checks

4. **Abstract Base Classes**
   ```python
   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
   from typing import Protocol, TypeVar, Generic

       def decide(self, market_data: MarketData) -> Decision: ...
       def learn(self, outcome: TradeOutcome) -> None: ...
   
   class NeuralArchitecture(ABC):

Create a system that doesn't just trade markets, but truly understands them at a deep, almost biological level. The codebase should be so well-organized and maintainable that new team members can contribute effectively within days, and the system can evolve and scale for years without architectural debt. The goal is artificial intelligence that exhibits genuine market intuition and creativity, built on a foundation of enterprise-grade software engineering practices.
