# Historical Data & Live Trading Fixes 🚀

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Intelligence Engine - Missing analyze_market Method ✅
- **Added comprehensive `analyze_market` method** to IntelligenceEngine
- **Fixed signal format compatibility** - returns both object format (`ai_signals['overall'].value`) and flat format
- **Added helper methods** for price patterns, temporal analysis, risk patterns, and regime adjustment

### 2. Market Data Processing Errors ✅  
- **Fixed timestamp validation** in feature extraction to prevent `[Errno 22] Invalid argument`
- **Added robust error handling** for numpy operations and data validation
- **Enhanced account data extraction** from raw market data

### 3. Trading Service Repository Issue ✅
- **Fixed create_trading_service factory** to accept config instead of repository
- **Created SimpleTradingService** as temporary solution for account info access
- **Eliminated `'dict' object has no attribute 'get_account_data'` error**

### 4. Signal Format Compatibility ✅
- **Updated analyze_market return format** to match expected structure
- **Added SignalObject class** with `.value` and `.confidence` attributes
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with flat signal values

## 🎯 Historical Data Flow (Working ✅)

Based on ResearchStrategy.cs analysis:

### NinjaTrader Sends:
```json

  "type": "historical_data",
  "bars_15m": [{"timestamp": ..., "open": ..., "high": ..., "low": ..., "close": ..., "volume": ...}],
  "bars_5m": [...],
  "bars_1m": [...],
  "bars_1h": [...], 
  "bars_4h": [...],
  "timestamp": ...
}
```

### NinjaTrader Live Data:
```json
{
  "type": "live_data",
  "price_1m": [array],
  "volume_1m": [array],
  "account_balance": 25000,
  "buying_power": 25000,
  "daily_pnl": 0,
